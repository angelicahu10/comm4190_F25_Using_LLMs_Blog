My name is Angelica and this first blog post is going to be getting to know a little bit about me while I explore how to use this platform haha! My experience with data science/coding comes from PHYS1100: Foundations of Data Science, which I took last semester as well as some other coding experience I did in high school.\n\n## My Family\n\nMy parents are from China, but me and my two older sisters were born here which makes us second generation. My older sisters both live in New York City now after graduating from college. This photo is from June from my middle sister's college graduation in Evanston, Illinois. I loveee Chicago!\n\nWe also have a dog named Minnie! She's a goldendoodle and turning 11 this year. I miss her a lot in college.\n\n::: {#fd3a85a7-7385-4908-a347-ad935b3e16f8 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage('family.JPG')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(\"minnie.jpg\")"
