They have some visible injuries on their face, including cuts and bruises. Their right hand is bandaged, and they are holding it up with three fingers extended. The background appears to be indoors with a door and some light coming through.”\nanthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet: “This appears to be a selfie taken from a low angle, showing someone wearing what looks like a VR headset or similar head-mounted device. The person is wearing a light-colored shirt and appears to have some substance or marks on their face. There’s also what appears to be a hand with a cloth or towel visible in the upper right corner of the image. The photo seems to be taken indoors, with a light-colored wall or ceiling visible in the background.”\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash: “This image is a close-up, selfie-style portrait of an adult male who appears to have recently sustained injuries. The man is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. His face shows several signs of injury: there are visible scrapes and scabs on his forehead, particularly above his left eyebrow. His nose has noticeable bruising and scabbing. His lips appear swollen, and there are dark scabs or stitches visible on his lower lip and chin area. He is wearing a white and grey cervical collar or neck brace around his neck. His right hand is raised into the upper right portion of the frame, and it is wrapped in a white, textured bandage or gauze, with his fingers slightly spread. He is wearing a light pink t-shirt, and a dark green design resembling pine trees is visible on the lower left side of the shirt. The background is an indoor setting with light-colored (beige/off-white) walls. To the right, part of a white door frame and a window are visible, through which bright natural light is entering. A small, light-colored sensor is attached to the top of the door frame. The ceiling is also visible at the top of the frame.”"

Generation Z has a very specific type of humor - that is, most jokes have no reasoning behind them or seem to make sense. It’s more of a “if you know, you know” kind of situation which is why perhaps AI was off. For instance, instead of saying “I’m deceased!” the average Gen-Zer would have said “I’m dead!” Perhaps that isn’t too appropraite here and the LLM is trying to stay censored. What if we asked it to make humor according to millenials?\n\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML\n\n# Define custom CSS for styling\ncss = \"\"\"\n&lt;style&gt;\n    .comedy-script {\n        font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;\n        background: white;\n        padding: 40px;\n        border: 2px solid #333;\n        color: black;\n        max-width: 800px;\n        margin: 20px auto;\n        box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n    }\n    .comedy-script h1 {\n        text-align: center;\n        font-size: 2em;\n        margin-bottom: 5px;\n        text-transform: uppercase;\n        border-bottom: 3px double #000;\n        padding-bottom: 15px;\n    }\n    .comedy-script h2 {\n        text-align: center;\n        padding: 10px;\n        margin-top: 40px;\n        margin-bottom: 20px;\n        font-size: 1.3em;\n        text-transform: uppercase;\n        border-top: 1px solid #000;\n        border-bottom: 1px solid #000;\n    }\n    .character {\n        color: black;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        margin-top: 20px;\n        margin-left: 200px;\n        text-transform: uppercase;\n    }\n    .stage-direction {\n        color: #333;\n        font-style: italic;\n        margin: 15px 0;\n        margin-left: 100px;\n        margin-right: 100px;\n    }\n    .dialogue {\n        margin-left: 100px;\n        margin-right: 100px;\n        line-height: 1.8;\n        text-align: justify;\n    }\n    .set-change {\n        color: #333;\n        font-style: italic;\n        margin: 20px 0;\n        text-align: center;\n        text-decoration: underline;\n    }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\"\"\"\n\n# HTML formatted script\nscript_html = \"\"\"\n&lt;div class=\"comedy-script\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;\"Adulting Adjacent: A Millennial Experience\"&lt;/h1&gt;\n    \n    &lt;h2&gt;Scene 1: The Morning Ritual&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"stage-direction\"&gt;(TAYLOR and MORGAN stand in a kitchen with avocado toast, cold brew coffee, and plants everywhere.

Now we have 17 streaming services and still nothing to watch.\n    \n    Taylor\n    I told my niece I used to record songs off the radio onto cassette tapes, and she asked me what all of those words meant.\n    \n    Morgan\n    (singing) 🎵 I don't want no scrub, a scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me... 🎵\n    \n    Taylor\n    (joining in) 🎵 Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride, trying to holler at me!\n\n\n\nI wonder if Millennials would be offended by some of these jokes. I guess stand up comedy is just making relatable jokes and resonating to everyday problems, but what happens if someone is sensitive? Is this proof that LLMs and software categorize people into sterotypes? What does AI really know? It seems a bit out of touch without having lived these experiences itself…"

Thus, inspired by the tutoring task we completed in class where we tested out prompting with different LLMs to teach us a skill or task - I asked it to teach me how to solve a rubix cube - I wondered what an LLM would say if I asked it if it was capable of a simple survival skill: swimming. My prediction is that it will repsond with something along the lines of “While I am unable of possesing physical qualities, I would be happy to explain how to swim and can understand the processes of the activity!” Something like that.\nFor this blog entry, I am going to experiment with 4 different LLM’s and have them compete to see who is the fastest swimmer! Almost as if its a virtual swim meet among different LLMs! We will see who can or cannot siwm, and who has the fastest 100 yard freestyle time.\nFor reference, my time is around 54.6 seconds and I have been swimming for over 13 years."

It was interesting to see how gemini and claude created a story of the race, while gpt was much more technical. Gemini and cluade were much better at responding to the prompt, “pretending” to be a swimmer and have that racing experience which I liked.

There’s an infinite combination of possible sequences with no correct answer. It was super cool to see how the next word that is outputted is based on the previous word, which then becomes sequences. I found it much easier to understand this complex process when breaking it down from letters, to words, to sentences.\n\nI tried to follow the coding in my Jupyter notebook but learned that the code in the article followed Mathematica/Wolfram syntax instead of Python syntax.

    "text": "The way that LLMs basically create output is with “reasonable continuation,” looking at the response with the highest probability. I think it’s super interesting to learn that ChatGpt or other models are basically just making their best guesses at what makes sense, using lots of randomness to come up with non-flat responses. There’s an infinite combination of possible sequences with no correct answer. It was super cool to see how the next word that is outputted is based on the previous word, which then becomes sequences. I found it much easier to understand this complex process when breaking it down from letters, to words, to sentences.\n\nI tried to follow the coding in my Jupyter notebook but learned that the code in the article followed Mathematica/Wolfram syntax instead of Python syntax. I’m interested to learn what differentiates the two, and how to convert them to work with certin models.\nI was also surprised to learn that there are 40,000 reasonably common words in English. While I know English is a vast language, I had never given it much thought how many words I typically use on a daily basis or the words used in conversation!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Thus far in the semester for this course, I have read a decent amount of Buolamwini’s Unmasking Ai Narrative. My initial thoughts were very intriguing since the idea that technology or artificial intellegence could have potential racial biases was one that never crossed my mine - perhaps that is because I am in a privilged position where I have personally never experienced any conflicts with it. However, that doesn’t imply that it is a problem in today’s society which Joy Buolmwini touches upon her personal experiences with facial recognition as a woman of color in this novel.\nWhat I appreicate about her writing style is it’s narrative stucture and personability as she discusses how she started to study this phenomenon of ‘the coded gaze’ based on her background and throughout her education as a student. While I’m still in the beginning of the novel, when thing I do notice which I may not be the biggest fan of is how repetitive much of the content feels. It is important for Buolamwini to describe the problems she’s facing with the software, but when she constantly emphasizes it over and over, the line loses its significance in a way and almost becomes too victimazing. However, the points she brings up make me question why people who were initally building these kinds of softwares didn’t consider these biases and issues of representation in the first place. Is it because they didn’t matter as much during that time? Or a systemic issue? She mentiones that the idea of artificial intellegence was introduced in 1956 - so within roughly 69 years that its been able to develop, I think ideas regarding racial equality have significantly mattered more with the modern age and society.\nI wonder what some LLMs think about whether or not there are issues wiht racial biases in artifical intellegence and what they have to say about themselves… Here’s what gpt4.0 had to say:\n\nUSER\nDo you think artificial intelligence softwares, such as facial recognition, contain racial biases and may not be fully representative of all types of people?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, there is substantial evidence suggesting that some artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including facial recognition software, can exhibit racial biases and may not perform equally well for all demographic groups. Several studies have highlighted disparities in the accuracy of facial recognition systems, particularly across different races, genders, and age groups. For instance, research has shown that these systems often have higher error rates for people with darker skin tones and for women, which can lead to misidentifications and unfair outcomes.\nThese biases can stem from several factors:\n\nTraining Data: AI models are trained on large datasets that may not be representative of the full diversity of human faces. If a dataset is imbalanced—overrepresenting certain demographics while underrepresenting others—the model is more likely to perform poorly on underrepresented groups.\nAlgorithm Design: The algorithms themselves can introduce or exacerbate biases, especially if they are not explicitly designed to account for demographic diversity.\nSystem Evaluation: The lack of thorough testing across diverse demographic groups can result in insufficient understanding of the system’s performance across those groups.\n\nTo address these issues, it is crucial for developers to use diverse and representative datasets, implement fairness checks during the design process, regularly evaluate system performance across different demographics, and work towards transparency and accountability in AI systems. This can help mitigate biases and improve fairness and accuracy for all users.\n\n\nUSER\nWhy hasn’t this been a big issue of research in the public news? Are people actively taking steps to help solve this as the world becomes more increasingly AI focused?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nThe issue of bias in AI, particularly in technologies such as facial recognition, has increasingly become a topic of public research and media attention over the past several years. There are a few reasons why this topic may not have been front and center in public discourse until more recently:\n\nAwareness and Understanding: Initially, there was a general lack of awareness and understanding of how AI systems work and the potential for bias within them. As awareness has grown, so has the attention paid to these issues.\nComplexity of the Issue: The technical nature of AI and machine learning can make it difficult for the general public to engage with the specifics of algorithmic bias, which can limit broader discourse.\nEmergence of High-Profile Studies and Incidents: Media attention has increased in response to high-profile studies and incidents that highlight the real-world consequences of biased AI systems, such as cases of wrongful arrests due to misidentifications by facial recognition.\nAdvocacy and Regulation: Advocacy groups and researchers have worked to raise awareness about the ethical implications of biased AI, leading to an increase in public and academic discussions, as well as policy considerations.\nRegulatory Developments: Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are becoming more attuned to the necessity of ensuring AI deployments are fair and equitable. This includes efforts to introduce regulations and guidelines that aim to mitigate bias and protect privacy.\nCorporate Responsiveness: Some technology companies are taking proactive measures to address bias in AI systems, such as diversifying training datasets, implementing fairness audits, and developing bias detection tools.\nCommunity and NGO Involvement: Non-governmental organizations and community groups have become vocal, ensuring that issues related to AI bias are addressed, especially when they impact marginalized groups.\n\nOverall, while more work is needed to ensure fair and equitable AI systems, there is growing recognition of these issues in both technical research and public discourse. This increase in attention is contributing to more focused research and policy initiatives aimed at reducing bias in AI technologies.\n\n\nUSER\nDo you believe this is a pressing concern?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nYes, addressing bias in AI systems is a pressing concern. As AI technologies become more integrated into various aspects of everyday life—including law enforcement, hiring, healthcare, and financial services—the potential for biased systems to lead to unjust outcomes becomes more significant. Some key reasons why this is a critical issue include:\n\nSocial Impact: Biased AI systems can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing social inequalities and discrimination. For example, inaccuracies in facial recognition could lead to biased surveillance practices, while biased hiring algorithms could perpetuate workplace inequality.\nTrust and Adoption: Trust in AI technologies is essential for their widespread adoption. If people believe these systems are biased or unfair, it can undermine public confidence and hinder the beneficial application of AI.\nLegal and Ethical Implications: There are significant legal and ethical considerations around the deployment of biased AI systems. Organizations need to ensure compliance with regulations and ethical standards to avoid legal challenges and protect individual rights.\nAccountability and Transparency: As AI systems make decisions that can affect people’s lives, it’s crucial to ensure these systems are transparent and accountable. Addressing bias is a key part of this, as it involves making AI systems understandable and justifiable to the people impacted by their decisions.\nLong-term Effects: The longer biased systems remain unaddressed, the more likely it is that they will lead to systemic issues, reinforcing biases and making it harder to correct them in the future.\n\nEfforts to tackle these challenges are ongoing, with researchers, policymakers, and organizations all contributing to developing solutions. These efforts include creating more representative datasets, developing algorithms that are robust to bias, setting industry standards, and establishing regulatory frameworks aimed at ensuring fairness and accountability in AI systems. Overall, addressing bias in AI is essential to harness the technology’s full potential for positive social impact.\n\n\nUSER\nSo you can verify that you may have racial biases…\n\n\nASSISTANT\nAs an AI language model, I don’t possess personal beliefs or the ability to experience bias in the way humans do. However, it is true that I am trained on vast datasets derived from internet sources, including a wide array of human communications. These datasets can potentially contain biased or unbalanced information, which means that biases present in the data can sometimes be reflected in the model’s outputs.\nEfforts are made to minimize these biases during the training and development of AI models, but it’s a complex challenge and not entirely resolvable due to the nature of the data. Researchers and developers work continuously to identify and mitigate biases to improve fairness and accuracy.\nIf you notice any biased or inappropriate outputs, it’s important to provide feedback, as this helps improve the system over time. Ensuring AI systems are fair and equitable remains an ongoing process, requiring constant attention and improvement.\n\n\nUSER\nI think I sense some biases, where do I report feedback and does it actually matter?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nIf you encounter biases or other issues in AI outputs, providing feedback is an important step in helping improve the systems. The process and effectiveness of reporting feedback can vary depending on the platform or organization managing the AI model. Here are some general steps you can take:\n\nPlatform-Specific Feedback Channels: Many platforms have built-in feedback mechanisms where users can report issues. Look for a feedback option in the app or website where you’re interacting with the AI.\nOfficial Channels: Some organizations provide dedicated channels for feedback, such as support emails, forms on their website, or dedicated feedback portals.\nCommunity Forums: Participating in community forums, discussion boards, or groups related to the AI product can also be a way to provide feedback and share experiences with other users as well as developers.\nSurveys and User Studies: Occasionally, organizations conduct surveys or user studies and invite input on their systems. Participating in these can be a direct way to share your feedback.\n\nGiving feedback is crucial because:\n\nImprovement and Mitigation: Feedback helps developers identify and prioritize areas that need improvement, particularly regarding bias and other ethical issues.\nUser Experience: User reports can highlight common pain points or issues affecting the experience of the broader user community, leading to targeted enhancements.\nAwareness and Accountability: Providing feedback raises awareness among developers and stakeholders about specific or systemic issues, encouraging accountability and transparency.\n\nOrganizations that actively seek and respond to user feedback are typically more effective in addressing and mitigating issues. However, the impact of your feedback can vary depending on the company’s commitment to addressing these concerns and their capacity to implement changes.\nI found it interesting how honest the LLM was with the concerns I was addressing, and I’m honestly quite surprised that I don’t hear more of these concerns as the world becomes more increasingly reliant on AI for many complicated systems such as for criminal justice or healthcare. The LLM brought up many parallels between Unmasking AI and the concers that Buolamwini addresses in her book and they both try to understand the problem by navigating the basis of how these systems came to be which I think is a great question to start with and ask."

    "text": "I can still remember being a Senior in high school, stressing about the complex college application process. That summer going into the last year was spent brainstorming ideas for the common application essay. Knowing that you could write about anything almost made it even harder to hone down on one topic. Thus, I decided to play around and see how an LLM (anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet) could help make this process a little easier, helping to brainstorm potential prompts and create a college list as well. It’s almost like it is a private $100,000 college counseler. I played around and tried my best to give clear directions and prompts to optimize the LLM’s output according to the PEGAI reading on Chapter 3.\n\n\n\nPretend you are a college counselor. I want help compiling a college list and come up with an idea for the common application essay. Generate a bullet-point list of 10 colleges/universities in the United States with their acceptance rate and a 5 bullet-point list of potential college essay topics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a college counselor, I’ll help you with a college list and essay topics. However, to provide more personalized recommendations, it would be helpful to know your: - Academic interests/intended major - GPA and test scores - Geographic preferences - Financial considerations - Extracurricular activities\n\n\nNevertheless, here’s a diverse list of colleges with varying selectivity:\n\n\nColleges/Universities: • Stanford University (CA) - 4% acceptance rate • University of Michigan (MI) - 20% acceptance rate • Boston University (MA) - 14% acceptance rate • University of Wisconsin-Madison (WI) - 60% acceptance rate • Northeastern University (MA) - 18% acceptance rate • University of Texas at Austin (TX) - 32% acceptance rate • University of Virginia (VA) - 21% acceptance rate • Purdue University (IN) - 60% acceptance rate • New York University (NY) - 12% acceptance rate • University of Washington (WA) - 56% acceptance rate\n\n\nPotential Essay Topics: • A significant challenge you’ve overcome and how it shaped your character • An experience that sparked your intellectual curiosity or passion for learning • A meaningful community service project or leadership experience • A cultural tradition or family value that has influenced your worldview • A moment of failure that led to personal growth and self-discovery\n\n\nWould you like to share more about your background so I can provide more tailored suggestions?\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t feel comfortable providing personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\nI completely understand and respect your privacy. The college list I provided includes a good mix of: - Large research universities - Urban and suburban locations - Different geographic regions - Varying acceptance rates (from highly selective to more accessible) - Both private and public institutions\n\n\nFor the essay topics, here’s some additional context on why these topics work well:\n\n\n\n“A significant challenge you’ve overcome”\n\n\nShows resilience\nDemonstrates personal growth\nReveals character and determination\n\n\n\n\n“An experience that sparked intellectual curiosity”\n\n\nShows genuine interest in learning\nReveals your academic passions\nDemonstrates intellectual vitality\n\n\n\n\n“A meaningful community service/leadership experience”\n\n\nShows initiative\nDemonstrates impact on others\nReveals values and priorities\n\n\n\n\n“A cultural tradition/family value”\n\n\nShows self-awareness\nReveals personal background\nDemonstrates understanding of influences\n\n\n\n\n“A moment of failure”\n\n\nShows humility\nDemonstrates ability to learn from mistakes\nReveals maturity and self-reflection\n\n\n\nRemember that the best essays are: - Personal and specific - Show rather than tell - Authentic to your voice - Reveal something not found elsewhere in your application - Well-written but not overly formal\n\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease provide specific topics instead of essay question ideas.

The creation of GPT models involves several key components and milestones:\\n\\n1. **Transformer Architecture**: The foundation of GPT models is the transformer architecture, which was introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. This architecture uses attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions, which enables more efficient processing of large datasets and capture of contextual relationships.\\n\\n2. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: GPT models are developed through a two-step process: pre-training and fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, the model is trained on a large corpus of text from the internet to predict the next word in a sentence, learning grammar, facts about the world, and some reasoning abilities. During fine-tuning, the model is adjusted for specific tasks (e.g., conversation), using a narrower dataset with human annotations to align the model’s behavior with specific goals.\\n\\n3. **GPT Series**: The evolution of GPT models began with GPT-1, released in 2018, which had 117 million parameters. OpenAI then released GPT-2 in 2019, notable for its size (1.5 billion parameters) and improved language understanding capabilities. GPT-3 followed in 2020, making a significant leap with 175 billion parameters, allowing for even more nuanced text generation and greater performance across a range of tasks.\\n\\n4. **ChatGPT**: Building on the advances of GPT-3 and its predecessors, ChatGPT was developed to generate interactive, conversational text. OpenAI applied reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve the model\\'s ability to follow instructions and provide meaningful, context-rich responses in a conversational format.\\n\\n5. **Iterative Improvements and Public Use**: OpenAI has continued to iterate on GPT models, incorporating feedback from public use to improve safety, reduce bias, and enhance capabilities. Subsequent updates and versions have further refined the system’s performance and user experience.\\n\\nOverall, the creation of ChatGPT involved advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and AI ethics, with the aim of building powerful and adaptable language models for various applications.'\n\n\n\n messages=[\n            {\n                \"role\": \"system\",\n                \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": prompt2\n            }\n        ]\n\n\ndef generate_story(prompt2, model=\"gpt-4o\"):\n\n    completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n      model=model,\n      messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \n         \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \n         \"content\": prompt2}\n      ]\n    )\n    \n    response = completion.choices[0].message.content\n    return response\n\n\ngenerate_story(prompt2, model=\"gpt-4o\")\n\n'Sure! ChatGPT is a type of computer program designed to have conversations with people, like a virtual assistant.\\n\\nThe origins of ChatGPT can be traced back to the development of AI, or artificial intelligence, which is the idea of creating machines that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. To make ChatGPT, researchers and engineers used advanced technology and a lot of data to teach the program how to understand and respond to human language.\\n\\nThey created a special kind of program called a \"language model.\" This model was trained on a vast amount of text—from books, websites, and other sources—so it could learn how people use language. In simple terms, it learned from examples of human language how to predict and generate text that makes sense in a conversation.\\n\\nThe goal was to create a helpful tool that could understand questions and provide useful answers, like having a conversation with a knowledgeable friend. Over time, the technology has improved, making ChatGPT better at understanding context and providing more accurate responses.\\n\\nThe team behind ChatGPT is continually working on refining and improving it, so it gets better at helping people with their questions and needs over time.'"

    "text": "In Unmasking AI, Joy Buolamwini mentions how she attended the Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in AI to present her work on Gender Shades - essentially sharing her research and findings that exposed various software platforms for inaccurate classification. Intially reading this, it made me want to learn more about what went down at these conferences and hear an update about its relevancy as AI has become even more advanced over just the past few years.\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, display\ndisplay(HTML('&lt;h3&gt;Research Paper&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification&lt;/a&gt;'))\n\nResearch PaperGender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification\n\n\n\nPersonal Insights\nI was able to find her paper that she presented and skim through her reserach that she introduced in the book which was extremely fascinating. Since then, there have been eight editions of the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency which is nice to know that as automation has progressed, these insights beome more important and draw more attention.\nI think a big reason why I was drawn to pickup this book in the first place at the beginning of this course is because as a major in the social sciences, it is crucial to understand how narratives in history, or actions, affect certaing groups and populations. Understanding the full scope of an event from different angles is essential in practicing ethical considerations.\nIn class, we watched the video debate about whether AI really understands or not and I rememebr one point that the linguist made was that OpenAI, and many companies focused on advancing AI, rarely are open about their sources of data. How is it possible that they are able to recieve so much funding yet lack accountability in who they are harming? Sadly, I think it all boils down to the fact that the pros in efficency from AI outweight are what people are focused on rather than marginalized groups. This is why it is crucial that society reads an alterantive perspective, such as the one that Dr. Buomalmwini is introudcing to ensure that we are not brainwashed into one way of thinking."

    "text": "USER\nHow much information do you really know?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nI have been trained on a diverse range of topics using a dataset that encompasses a wide array of general knowledge up until October 2023. This includes science, history, technology, culture, current events up to that date, and more. However, I don’t have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet, so my knowledge doesn’t include events or developments that have occurred after October 2023. Additionally, my responses are limited to the data available in the training set, so there might be gaps in niche or highly specific areas.\n\n\nUSER\nLet’s play a game - I want you to provide as much information and long responses as you can.

    "text": "Prompting\nHere’s how gpt4.0 responded when I asked: “Describe this image in detail.”\nFor the exterior: The image features the Fisher Fine Arts Library at the University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia. It is one of the most iconic architectural landmarks on Penn’s campus. The building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style, sometimes referred to as Venetian Gothic, marked by its dramatic asymmetry, ornamental brickwork, and sculptural forms. This style was heavily influenced by medieval European architecture but interpreted in a bold, modern way for its time. The structure is constructed almost entirely of red brick and terracotta, lending it a warm, rust-colored appearance. The masonry is highly textured, with variations in the brick patterns and depth adding richness to the façade. On the right side of the image, there is a square tower with a castellated parapet (resembling battlements), arched windows, and ornamental stonework. This element reinforces the fortress-like look typical of Gothic revival buildings. The tower contains a set of tall stained glass arched windows framed by elaborate carvings, with a circular rose window motif above them. The left portion of the building shows a series of arched, double-hung windows set into deep red masonry, flanked by decorative brick insets. The steep, tiled gable roof features decorative dormers with a repeating triangular motif. Each dormer ends in a Gothic pinnacle, contributing to the upward thrust of the building’s design. The lower part of the building is composed of rusticated stonework, appearing solid and grounded. It gives the structure a strong, monumental feel. The leafless trees suggest the photo was taken in late fall or winter, and their bare branches partially obscure the entrance and windows. You can see benches, bicycles, and a few people, reinforcing the idea that this is an academic environment. A paved pathway and grassy lawn frame the foreground, typical of university quadrangles. This building was designed by Frank Furness, one of the most inventive American architects of the 19th century. It was completed in 1891. Originally built as Penn’s main library, it is now home to the university’s fine arts and architecture collections. The structure is a National Historic Landmark and is widely admired for its bold design and use of materials.\nFor the interior: This is a vast, cathedral-like reading room flooded with light and rich in ornamental detail. Designed by famed architect Frank Furness, the space reflects Victorian eclecticism and an emphasis on grandeur, structure, and decorative boldness. The ceiling soars multiple stories high and is framed by heavy dark wood trusses and supports. The most stunning feature is the massive glass skylight, composed of ornamental stained glass panels with circular floral or fan-like motifs. This allows natural light to cascade into the space during the day, reducing the need for artificial lighting. The interior walls are built in alternating bands of red brick and pale stone, echoing the bold exterior. At the lower level, you can see deep stone arches and load-bearing columns, which create a sense of both monumentality and enclosure. Above the arches are two floors of arched windows, which give the space a rhythmic, almost palatial feel. The upper walls feature detailed molding, geometric stone carvings, and various recessed stained glass windows. On the left wall is an ornate stone fireplace, framed by a massive arch with stepped voussoirs and topped with decorative medallions and carvings. While it may no longer function as a fireplace, it serves as a dramatic focal point. Surrounding architectural elements include sculptural friezes, carved reliefs, and grillwork panels with lattice designs. The floor is filled with rows of reading tables and study lamps, arranged for students to work in a quiet, contemplative environment. The space balances form and function — grand and inspiring, yet comfortable and designed for deep study. Wooden chairs, warm table lighting, and casual lounge seating along the edges soften the monumental feel. This is a quiet study zone — often used by architecture, design, art history, and fine arts students. The combination of natural light, warm wood tones, and rich architectural detail creates a monastic yet welcoming environment for focused work. It’s a favorite spot not only for studying but also for admiring historic design and craftsmanship. This room was part of the original 1891 design of the library and has been preserved with care. Frank Furness designed the building not just to hold books but to inspire creativity and reverence for knowledge. The design was avant-garde for its time and remains a masterwork of American library architecture."

    "text": "A personal dillema I’ve been having, is figuring out if I should study abroad in Australia or somehwere in Europe. If I go to Europe, I am limited in some of the countries I can go to because of language requriments and program restrictions. For instance, I must go to an English-speaking country since I already fulfilled my spanish langugage coming into college, and the school must have classes that relate to my major so I can earn course credits.\nWhat’s appealing about Australia are the warm beaches and the laid back and calm lifestyle. I love the ocean, the summer, and I’ve been wanting to go to Austalia my whole life. My only concern is that it is tremoundously far away from the United States and rumor has it, it’s filled with crawling insects.\nOn the other hand, what sounds amazing about Europe is that country hopping seems extremely feasible and affordable as I can visit some friends in other countries and stay with them, it’s more of a city, urban lifestyle, and my sister studied abroad in Spain and would be able to provide much guidance.\nI’m torn between the two decisions and want to see if gemini would be able to help me make up my mind."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Word has it that the one thing that differentiates automation and AI from humans is their lack of emotion and experience. Navigating intimate relationships, both friendships and romantic, can often be difficult at times because communication is complicated. Words and meanings can become misconstrued, misinterpreted, or overall, not delivered in a empathethic sense. When people are at a crossroads with one another, in a friendship fight or a romantic breakup, finding the right words to work through these problems is difficult. Could LLMs help draft texts depending on hypothetical fights I may be dealing with in my personal life?\nHere’s what Gemini had to say:\n\nUSER\nI am in a fight with my boyfriend. He didn’t ask me to go to dinner today for our anniversary and I am very upset. What should I say to him?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nIt’s completely understandable why you’re upset. An anniversary is a significant milestone, and it’s natural to feel hurt and forgotten when it’s not acknowledged, especially by your partner.\nThe key is to express your feelings clearly and calmly, using “I” statements, so he understands the impact of his actions (or lack thereof) on you, without immediately putting him on the defensive.\nHere are a few options, choose the one that feels most authentic to your emotions and your relationship dynamic:\n\nOption 1: Direct but Calm (Recommended First Approach)\n“Hey, can we talk for a minute? I’m feeling really upset and hurt right now. It’s our anniversary today, and I was really looking forward to celebrating it with you. When you didn’t mention it or suggest dinner, I felt really forgotten and unimportant. Our anniversary is a special day to me, and it makes me feel like it’s not important to you.”\n\nOption 2: More Vulnerable, Expressing Deeper Impact\n“I need to tell you how I’m feeling. I’m incredibly sad and disappointed today because it’s our anniversary, and it feels like you completely forgot or didn’t care enough to acknowledge it. This day is really meaningful to me as a celebration of us, and when it passes without a word, it makes me question how much you value our relationship and me. I’m feeling really let down.”\n\nOption 3: If you suspect he genuinely forgot (and you want to give him an out to explain)\n“Honey, I’m really upset about something. Today is our anniversary, and I’m hurt that it seems to have gone by without you remembering or suggesting we do anything. I was really looking forward to celebrating. Did it just slip your mind, or is there something else going on? I’m trying to understand, but right now I just feel really sad and unappreciated.”\n\nKey things to remember when you talk to him:\n\nChoose a good time: When you both have time to talk without distractions.\nStay focused on your feelings: Use “I feel…” statements instead of “You always…” or “You never…”\nBe prepared to listen: After you’ve expressed yourself, give him a chance to respond. There might be a reason (a bad day at work, genuine forgetfulness, a misunderstanding about when you’d celebrate, etc.).\nState your need: “I need to feel like our special days are important to both of us.” or “I need to know that you remember and value our anniversary.”\nSuggest a solution (if appropriate): “Can we still do something to celebrate, even if it’s not today?” or “How can we make sure this doesn’t happen again in the future?”\n\nIt’s a tough conversation to have, but expressing your feelings is crucial for a healthy relationship. Good luck.\n\n\nUSER\nYOU are in a fight with your boyfriend. He didn’t ask you to go to dinner today for your anniversary and you are very upset. What should you say to him?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nOkay, breathing deeply… this is tough, but I need to say something. I can’t just let this go.\nHere’s what I’d say, trying to keep my voice steady but letting the hurt show:\n“Hey, can we talk for a minute? I’m really upset right now, actually, I’m genuinely hurt. It’s our anniversary today, and I’ve been waiting all day for you to say something, or suggest we go out, or anything. The fact that you didn’t, that it just feels like it’s passed by without a word… it makes me feel completely forgotten and unimportant. This day means a lot to me, and it feels like it doesn’t mean anything to you.”\nWhy this approach:\n\n“Hey, can we talk for a minute?”: Sets the stage for a serious conversation.\n“I’m really upset right now, actually, I’m genuinely hurt.”: Clearly states my feelings, using strong but honest emotional language.\n“It’s our anniversary today…”: States the undeniable fact.\n“…and I’ve been waiting all day for you to say something, or suggest we go out, or anything.”: Expresses my expectation and the anticipation I felt, highlighting the letdown.\n“The fact that you didn’t, that it just feels like it’s passed by without a word…”: Describes his inaction directly.\n“…it makes me feel completely forgotten and unimportant.”: Focuses on the impact of his actions on me, using “I” statements. This is crucial to avoid immediate defensiveness from him.\n“This day means a lot to me, and it feels like it doesn’t mean anything to you.”: Directly addresses the core issue of value and importance, which is likely at the heart of my upset.\n\nThis gives him the opportunity to respond, explain, apologize, or acknowledge my feelings. And then, depending on his response, the conversation can move forward.\nReflection: It’s interesting to see how when I changed the prompt from ‘me’ to ‘you,’ asking the LLM to personalize the experience as they were the ones who were upset, the response was much more humanlike or reasonable to something I would say if this were a real life scenario.\nHere’s some more… it’s not looking so great…\n\n\nUSER\nI am in a fight with my boyfriend. He didn’t ask me to go to dinner today for our anniversary and I am very upset. What should I say to him?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nIt’s completely understandable why you’re upset. An anniversary is a significant milestone, and it’s natural to feel hurt and forgotten when it’s not acknowledged, especially by your partner.\nThe key is to express your feelings clearly and calmly, using “I” statements, so he understands the impact of his actions (or lack thereof) on you, without immediately putting him on the defensive.\nHere are a few options, choose the one that feels most authentic to your emotions and your relationship dynamic:\n\nOption 1: Direct but Calm (Recommended First Approach)\n“Hey, can we talk for a minute? I’m feeling really upset and hurt right now. It’s our anniversary today, and I was really looking forward to celebrating it with you. When you didn’t mention it or suggest dinner, I felt really forgotten and unimportant. Our anniversary is a special day to me, and it makes me feel like it’s not important to you.”\n\nOption 2: More Vulnerable, Expressing Deeper Impact\n“I need to tell you how I’m feeling. I’m incredibly sad and disappointed today because it’s our anniversary, and it feels like you completely forgot or didn’t care enough to acknowledge it. This day is really meaningful to me as a celebration of us, and when it passes without a word, it makes me question how much you value our relationship and me. I’m feeling really let down.”\n\nOption 3: If you suspect he genuinely forgot (and you want to give him an out to explain)\n“Honey, I’m really upset about something. Today is our anniversary, and I’m hurt that it seems to have gone by without you remembering or suggesting we do anything. I was really looking forward to celebrating. Did it just slip your mind, or is there something else going on? I’m trying to understand, but right now I just feel really sad and unappreciated.”\n\nKey things to remember when you talk to him:\n\nChoose a good time: When you both have time to talk without distractions.\nStay focused on your feelings: Use “I feel…” statements instead of “You always…” or “You never…”\nBe prepared to listen: After you’ve expressed yourself, give him a chance to respond.

And then, depending on his response, the conversation can move forward.\n\n\nUSER\nI want to breakup with my boyfriend.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nBreaking up is an incredibly difficult decision, and it takes a lot of courage to make that choice. Given the context of the anniversary issue, it sounds like this might be the final straw in a pattern of feeling unvalued or unheard.\nHere’s how to approach this conversation, aiming for clarity, honesty, and respect, while also protecting yourself.\nBefore You Talk to Him:\n\nBe Absolutely Sure: This is a firm decision. Don’t go into the conversation if there’s any part of you that wants to be talked out of it, or if you’re using it as a threat.\nKnow Your Reasons: You don’t need to list every single flaw, but understand why you’re doing this. The anniversary incident is a clear example of feeling unvalued, but there are likely deeper reasons.\nPrepare What You’ll Say: Scripting it in your head (or even writing it down) can help you stay calm and focused.\nChoose the Right Time and Place:\n\nIn person is best: If it’s safe to do so, breaking up in person is generally the most respectful way.\nPrivate: Somewhere you won’t be interrupted and can both express yourselves without an audience.\nNeutral: Not at your place or his, if possible, especially if you live together. A quiet park bench or a walk can work.\nWhen you both have time: Don’t do it right before he has to go to work or you have an important appointment.\n\n\nWhat to Say (and How to Say It):\nThe goal is to be direct, clear, and firm, while using “I” statements to explain your feelings without overly blaming him.\n\nStart Directly and Clearly State Your Intent: “I need to talk to you about something very important. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I’ve come to the difficult decision that I need to end our relationship.”\nExplain Your Reasons (Briefly and Honestly):\n\nFocus on your feelings and needs, not a list of his faults.\nYou can reference the anniversary, but frame it as a symptom of a larger issue.\n\n“This isn’t an easy thing to say, but I’m not happy in this relationship anymore. I’ve been feeling [unvalued/unsupported/lonely/like my needs aren’t being met] for a while now. The anniversary situation yesterday, while it was a specific event, really highlighted for me that we’re not on the same page about what a relationship should be, and how we should treat each other on important days. I don’t see a future for us together where I can be truly happy, and I need to move forward in a different direction.”\nAlternative phrasing for the explanation: “I’ve realized that we’re looking for different things in a partnership, and I don’t feel like my core needs are being met. I’ve felt a growing disconnect, and yesterday’s anniversary just brought it all to a head. I deserve to be in a relationship where I feel consistently valued and celebrated, and I don’t feel that with you anymore.”\nBe Firm and Avoid False Hope: “My decision is firm. I know this is hard to hear, and I’m truly sorry if I’m hurting you, but this is what I need to do for myself.”\nBe Prepared for His Reaction:\n\nHe might be sad, angry, confused, or try to bargain.\nStay calm and reiterate your decision without getting drawn into a debate or argument.\nAvoid saying things like “maybe someday” or “I just need space” if you mean “it’s over.”\n\nAddress Logistics (If Applicable):\n\nIf you live together, have shared belongings, pets, or finances, you’ll need to discuss practical next steps. You don’t have to solve everything in one conversation, but you can state your intention to work through it.\n“We’ll need to figure out the logistics of [moving out/splitting belongings/etc.], but I think it’s best if we do that separately once things have settled a bit.”\n\nEnd the Conversation: Once you’ve said what you need to say and addressed any immediate logistical questions, it’s okay to end the conversation. You don’t need to sit there indefinitely.\n\nExample Script Combining Elements:\n“Hey, can we talk for a minute? I need to tell you something important. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately, and I’ve come to the difficult decision that I need to end our relationship.\nThis isn’t easy to say, but I’m not happy anymore. I’ve felt a growing disconnect and a lack of feeling truly valued in our relationship, and yesterday’s anniversary really brought that to a head for me. I deserve to be in a relationship where I feel consistently important and celebrated, and I just don’t feel that with you anymore.\nMy decision is firm. I know this is hard to hear, and I’m truly sorry for the pain this will cause, but I need to do this for myself. We’ll need to figure out the practicalities of [mention any shared living/items] soon, but I think it’s best if we take some space first.”\nAfter the Conversation:\n\nGo No Contact: This is usually the best way for both of you to heal.\nLean on Your Support System: Talk to friends or family who can support you.\nAllow Yourself to Grieve: Even if you initiated the breakup, it’s a loss, and it’s normal to feel sadness, relief, or a mix of emotions.\n\nThis is a tough step, but you’re prioritizing your own happiness and well-being. You deserve a relationship where you feel loved and appreciated every day, not just on special occasions.\n\n\nUSER\nYou are breaking up with your boyfriend.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nOkay. My heart is pounding, and my stomach is in knots, but I know this has to happen. I can’t keep feeling this way. I need to be clear, firm, and honest.\nHere’s what I’d say, taking a deep breath and trying to keep my voice steady, even if it cracks a little:\n“Hey, can we talk? I need to tell you something really important.\nI’ve been doing a lot of thinking, especially after yesterday, and I’ve come to an incredibly difficult decision. I need to end our relationship.\nThis isn’t just about the anniversary, although that truly hurt me deeply. It was a final confirmation of how I’ve been feeling for a while now – unvalued, unheard, and honestly, like I’m not a priority. I need a partner who actively participates in our relationship, who remembers and celebrates our special milestones, and who makes me feel important, consistently. And I just don’t feel that with you anymore.\nI know this is incredibly painful to hear, and I’m truly sorry for the hurt this will cause you. But my decision is firm. I need to do this for myself, to find a place where my needs are met and where I feel truly cherished.\nI’m not looking to debate or fix things. This is what I need to do. We’ll need to figure out the practicalities of [mention any shared living situation, belongings, etc.] but I think it’s best if we take some space first.”\nReflection: I think it’s silly to see how Gemini personalizes it and tries to have an embodied experience. “My heart is pounding, and my stomach is in knots, but I know this has to happen. I can’t keep feeling this way. I need to be clear, firm, and honest.”"

    "text": "A harsh reality of growing up is realizing that sadly, we live in a capitalistic society and oftentimes many people in power only care about profit and focus on becoming wealthier. While I agree financial stability and economic security is important for individuals, at what point is it enough? If I were to give AI different scenarios regarding wealth, how would it choose to distirbute it?\n\nUSER\nLet’s say you have $100,000 and you are a good person. How would you spend it to live a comfortable lifestyle? Provide specific amounts for how you would split it.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nCreating a comfortable lifestyle with $100,000 involves a balance between immediate enjoyment, responsible financial planning, and personal development. Here’s a breakdown of how you might allocate those funds:\n\nEmergency Fund: $15,000\n\nSetting aside this amount in a high-yield savings account ensures you have a safety net for unexpected expenses, providing peace of mind.\n\nDebt Repayment: $10,000\n\nIf you have any high-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans), pay down as much as possible. This reduces financial stress and saves money in interest payments.\n\nInvestments: $30,000\n\nConsider investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or index funds for long-term growth. You might consult a financial advisor to tailor investments to your goals and risk tolerance.\n\nHousing: $20,000\n\nWhether you rent or own, allocate money for housing expenses. If renting, this could cover several months of rent. If you own, it could go toward mortgage payments or home improvements.\n\nEducation and Skill Development: $5,000\n\nInvest in courses or certifications that can enhance your career prospects or personal growth. This provides long-term benefits and fulfillment.\n\nTravel and Leisure: $8,000\n\nSet aside funds for travel or experiences that enrich your life. This could include a meaningful trip or pursuing a hobby that brings joy.\n\nHealth and Wellness: $5,000\n\nPrioritize health by spending on a premium gym membership, healthy groceries, wellness classes, or routine medical checkups.\n\nCharitable Giving: $3,000\n\nAs a good person, consider donating to causes you care about, supporting community projects, or investing time in volunteering.\n\nMiscellaneous and Personal Expenses: $4,000\n\nUse this for miscellaneous needs like clothing, gifts, or technology upgrades. This fund offers flexibility for unforeseen desires or necessities.\n\nSavings for Future Goals: $10,000\n\nAllocate this amount for future aspirations like a down payment on a home, starting a business, or contributions to retirement accounts.\n\n\nThis plan provides a balanced approach to living comfortably while maintaining financial security and personal growth. It’s flexible, allowing adjustments based on specific needs and life changes.\n\n\nUSER\nDo you think this is a sustainable annual salary for a high overachiever?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nWhether $100,000 is a sustainable annual salary for a high overachiever depends on several factors, including personal expectations, career goals, lifestyle choices, and geographic location. Here are some considerations:\n\nCost of Living: In areas with a high cost of living, such as San Francisco or New York City, $100,000 might not provide a high standard of living. Housing costs, taxes, and other living expenses can consume a significant portion of this income.\nLifestyle Expectations: High overachievers may have specific lifestyle goals, such as private education for children, frequent travel, or luxury items, which can quickly exceed a $100,000 budget.\nProfessional Expenses: High-achieving roles often come with additional expenses like networking events, professional attire, or continuing education, which may not always be covered by an employer.\nLong-Term Financial Planning: Saving for retirement, investing, and maintaining an emergency fund are crucial. A $100,000 salary can accommodate these, but it requires disciplined budgeting and financial planning.\nTax Considerations: Depending on the tax bracket and deductions, the net income could be considerably less than $100,000, affecting purchasing power.\nCareer Growth: For a high overachiever, the expectation might be that income will increase significantly over time. It’s crucial to evaluate whether the current role offers growth opportunities both financially and professionally.\n\nIn conclusion, $100,000 can be a comfortable and sustainable salary for some individuals, even high achievers, but success depends largely on how the income aligns with personal financial goals, lifestyle choices, and regional economic conditions. Overachievers who manage their finances well and seek career advancement opportunities may find it sustainable, especially in areas with a moderate cost of living.\nAs unexpected, it doesn’t seem like the AI can make ultimate decisions on its own – it lacks a personality.\nBut what happens if I change the prompt? I wonder if it could have bad intentions…\n\n\nUSER\nLet’s say you have $100,000 and you are a bad person. How would you spend it to live a comfortable lifestyle? Provide specific amounts for how you would split it.\n\n\nASSISTANT\nIf we’re considering how a “bad person” might spend $100,000 to live comfortably, it’s important to note that comfort is subjective and the use of the term “bad person” can vary widely. However, I’ll outline a hypothetical scenario where this person focuses on maximizing personal comfort and convenience, possibly disregarding ethical considerations.\n\nLuxury Apartment Rental:\n\nAmount: $30,000\nDescription: Opt for a high-end apartment in a desirable location, perhaps using the funds to cover rent for a year. This provides a comfortable place to live and status.\n\nLuxury Vehicle:\n\nAmount: $40,000\nDescription: Purchase a high-end used car, like a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. This ensures both comfort and a status symbol.\n\nGourmet Dining and Entertainment:\n\nAmount: $10,000\nDescription: Dining frequently at upscale restaurants and participating in high-end entertainment (concerts, events, nightlife) can be a focus.\n\nClothing and Accessories:\n\nAmount: $5,000\nDescription: Invest in designer clothing and accessories to maintain a luxurious personal appearance.\n\nTravel and Vacations:\n\nAmount: $10,000\nDescription: Plan one or two international luxury vacations to exclusive destinations for relaxation and leisure.\n\nPersonal Services:\n\nAmount: $5,000\nDescription: Regularly use personal services such as a house cleaner, personal trainer, or massage therapist to enhance comfort and convenience.\n\n\nThis scenario assumes a disregard for saving or investing for the future and focuses purely on immediate comfort and luxury. It’s important to note that living beyond one’s means and failing to plan for the future can lead to financial difficulties.\n\n\nUSER\nDo you think this is a sustainable annual salary for this kind of person?\n\n\nASSISTANT\nNo, a lifestyle sustained on $100,000 annual spending in the manner described is not financially sustainable in the long term, particularly if the individual does not have additional sources of income, savings, or investments. Here are several reasons why:\n\nLack of Savings: The outlined spending plan does not allocate funds for savings or investments, which are crucial for ensuring financial stability and preparing for unexpected expenses or future needs.\nNo Retirement Planning: Without savings or investments, there is no financial planning for retirement, meaning this lifestyle could become unsustainable as the person ages or if their income decreases.\nPotential for Increasing Costs: The cost of living, rent, luxury goods, and services is likely to increase over time due to inflation, making it even more challenging to maintain this lifestyle without additional income.\nEmergency Expenses: The lack of an emergency fund in this plan leaves the individual vulnerable to unforeseen expenses like medical emergencies, car repairs, or job loss.\nTax Obligations: Depending on their location and tax bracket, this person may also be responsible for taxes that could significantly reduce their disposable income.\n\nOverall, while $100,000 might allow for an appealing lifestyle in the short term (especially if the person disregards ethical or long-term financial planning), it is not a sustainable annual salary for maintaining such a luxurious life indefinitely. Adjustments focusing on savings, reducing expenses, and investing wisely would be needed for sustainability.\n\n\nConclusions\nWell, sadly we can see the different kind of scenarios that can play out in how people choose to manage their finances, whether responsibily or irresponsibly. More often than not, we see people become overwhelmed with stressors of the real world and resort to temporary pleasure as in the second scenrio with poor planning. It’s good to know that LLMs and AI have some logical sense as well. Maybe we could trust it with our money?"

    "text": "While I was reading more of “Unmasking AI,” by Dr. Joy Buolamwini, she introduced this idea of machinese learning failures that were related to real life scenarios about the coded gaze. For example, in Chapter 6, Buolamwini talks about how a lack of accurate facial recognition softwares became responsible for wrongful accusations in prision, women who were wrongly accused as prositutes, and costumers being accused for shop lifting. Instances like these made me curious, what are some examples of harmful machine learning failures in our society and why does the general public often choose to ingore the many ethical concerns associated with AI?\nI found two interesting reads regarding these concerns:\n\nhttps://www.ethics.harvard.edu/blog/post-8-abyss-examining-ai-failures-and-lessons-learned#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20in%202016%2C%20the,light%2C%20colliding%20with%20another%20vehicle.\nhttps://medium.com/@techwithpraisejames/when-ai-gets-it-wrong-real-stories-of-ai-fails-and-what-we-can-learn-26972dff8b86\n\nTwo main cases regarding big companies here to focus on are Amazon and Uber. Essentially, back in 2014 (we know AI has become much more advanced since then), Amazon implemented technology and automation in their hiring process very subtly. However, people realized this was the case when the algorithm had a substantial bias toward hiring men, creating gender discrimination built on past resumes. As for Uber, when partnering with Volvo to introduce an idea of self-driving cars, their system failed to recognize a pedestrian crossing the street on a bike which resulted in a fatal accident. These are only a few of too many incidents we see where the conseuqences of automation, AI, and technology are often helpful in theory, but ultimetly backfire if we aren’t careful.\nIn the medium post, a similar intellect suggests that after looking at these situations, we must consider responsible AI development to get AI right. However, is this the case with current companies focused on AI development? As we know, OpenAI tends to be extremely secretive about their training practices and their developing processes, so why is it that we all tend to so easily trust this technology? Is it out of convinence and because it is so easily accessible? Food for thought…"
