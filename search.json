    "text": "The way that LLMs basically create output is with “reasonable continuation,” looking at the response with the highest probability. I think it’s super interesting to learn that ChatGpt or other models are basically just making their best guesses at what makes sense, using lots of randomness to come up with non-flat responses. There’s an infinite combination of possible sequences with no correct answer. It was super cool to see how the next word that is outputted is based on the previous word, which then becomes sequences. I found it much easier to understand this complex process when breaking it down from letters, to words, to sentences.\n\nI tried to follow the coding in my Jupyter notebook but learned that the code in the article followed Mathematica/Wolfram syntax instead of Python syntax. I’m interested to learn what differentiates the two, and how to convert them to work with certin models.\nI was also surprised to learn that there are 40,000 reasonably common words in English. While I know English is a vast language, I had never given it much thought how many words I typically use on a daily basis or the words used in conversation!"

They have some visible injuries on their face, including cuts and bruises. Their right hand is bandaged, and they are holding it up with three fingers extended. The background appears to be indoors with a door and some light coming through.”\nanthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet: “This appears to be a selfie taken from a low angle, showing someone wearing what looks like a VR headset or similar head-mounted device. The person is wearing a light-colored shirt and appears to have some substance or marks on their face. There’s also what appears to be a hand with a cloth or towel visible in the upper right corner of the image. The photo seems to be taken indoors, with a light-colored wall or ceiling visible in the background.”\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash: “This image is a close-up, selfie-style portrait of an adult male who appears to have recently sustained injuries. The man is looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. His face shows several signs of injury: there are visible scrapes and scabs on his forehead, particularly above his left eyebrow. His nose has noticeable bruising and scabbing. His lips appear swollen, and there are dark scabs or stitches visible on his lower lip and chin area. He is wearing a white and grey cervical collar or neck brace around his neck. His right hand is raised into the upper right portion of the frame, and it is wrapped in a white, textured bandage or gauze, with his fingers slightly spread. He is wearing a light pink t-shirt, and a dark green design resembling pine trees is visible on the lower left side of the shirt. The background is an indoor setting with light-colored (beige/off-white) walls. To the right, part of a white door frame and a window are visible, through which bright natural light is entering. A small, light-colored sensor is attached to the top of the door frame. The ceiling is also visible at the top of the frame.”"
