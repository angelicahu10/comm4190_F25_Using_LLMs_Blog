    "Lucky enough, I've had a good number of family and friends come visit me in Philly. I think mainly because I enjoy hosting people and like showing them around! At this point, I feel like I have a good understanding of the city and what is worth showing them, so it's like I have my own personal tour route. When I have a visitor, we will typically walk along the Schuylkill River Trail, into Rittenhouse or Center City, pass the shops in Liberty, and see City Hall. From there, we will typically make a stop at Reading Terminal Market, and if we are feeling up to it, explore Old City which is also beautiful. It's a pretty classic and simple Philadelphia tour that is all walking distance to the campus of Penn. After basically nailing this tour down, and I have a friend who is coming to visit me this weekend, it made me wonder what kind of Phialdelphia Tour an LLM would reccomend. How much does it align with mine?"

    "This does sound like an accurate representation of Philadelphia (although a bit too touristy to my liking). It looks like we both would show our visior Penn's campus, Rittenhouse Square, Reading Terminal, and City Hall. After living here for about a year now, I wonder if there's a niche place I would show them that AI wouldn't think to show them. Maybe some of my favorite small streets within Rittenhouse/Fairmonunt? Or Boathouse Row?"
