    "Today, I went to Parc for lunch which is a nice restuarant right in the heart of Rittenhouse Square. I had heard much hype about this place from my friends who have been there -- it has french cuisine and was super festivly decorated which made it feel both sophisticated and cozy. Some other well known resturants among the college crowd are Double Knot, Guiseppe and Sons, Tunabar, and The Love. I wanted to see how specific an untrained LLM could be at helping me pick a Philadelphia restuarant for dinner! "
