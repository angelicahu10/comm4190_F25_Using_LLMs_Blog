    "    <li><b>Country Hopping Feasible & Affordable:</b> This is Europe's undisputed strength. Low-cost airlines, extensive train networks, and close proximity mean you can realistically visit many countries. If your goal is to see as much of the world as possible in one semester, Europe wins.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Visit Friends & Sister:</b> The social aspect is huge. Being able to easily meet up with friends who are also abroad, and having your sister's direct guidance (especially if you choose Spain or a similar country), provides a strong comfort blanket and built-in support system.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>City/Urban Lifestyle:</b> If you thrive on the hustle and bustle, diverse architecture, museums, historical sites, and vibrant nightlife of major cities, Europe offers an incredible array of choices.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>More Friends in Contact:</b> This is a significant draw. It means less potential for feeling isolated, and more shared experiences with your immediate social circle from Penn.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Diverse Health & Societies Perspectives:</b> Europe offers a wide range of healthcare systems (universal, mixed, etc.), public health challenges (aging populations, migration, specific diseases), and social policies across different countries.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Things to Consider:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Potential for \"Travel Burnout\":</b> While exciting, constantly planning weekend trips can be exhausting and expensive. Make sure you also dedicate time to truly immersing yourself in your host city.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Less \"Unique\" for some:</b> While amazing, many people visit Europe throughout their lives. Will this feel as truly \"once-in-a-lifetime\" as Australia, given your lifelong dream?</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Language Barrier (if not English-speaking country):</b> While many Europeans speak English, daily life and deeper cultural immersion can be richer if you learn some of the local language.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>How to Make Up Your Mind: Ask Yourself These Questions</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b>What is your <i>primary</i> goal for study abroad?</b><br>\n",
    "        Is it to travel extensively and see as many places as possible (Europe)?<br>\n",
    "        Is it to deeply immerse yourself in one truly unique culture and environment, fulfilling a personal dream (Australia)?<br>\n",
    "        Is it primarily academic? (Refer back to step 1).</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Which experience would you regret <i>not</i> having more?</b><br>\n",
    "        Would you regret missing out on your lifelong dream of Australia, knowing it's a harder trip to make later in life?<br>\n",
    "        Or would you regret missing the opportunity to easily hop around Europe with friends?</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Comfort vs. Challenge:</b><br>\n",
    "        Do you want the comfort of a strong social network and sister's guidance (Europe)?<br>\n",
    "        Or are you ready for a more independent, far-flung adventure that might push you further out of your comfort zone (Australia)?</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Your Personality:</b><br>\n",
    "        Are you someone who thrives on novelty and unique experiences, even if it means being further from home?<br>\n",
    "        Or are you someone who values close social connections and the ease of travel with friends?</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>The \"Health and Societies\" Angle:</b> Does one location genuinely excite you more in terms of the specific issues or systems you could study? For example, Australia might offer unique insights into indigenous health, while a European country might offer a deep dive into a specific universal healthcare model.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Recommendation (My Gut Feeling Based on Your Words):</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your description, especially the phrase <b>\"I've been wanting to go to Australia my whole life,\"</b> and your love for the ocean and summer, <b>Australia sounds like the stronger pull for <i>you</i>.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"lifelong dream\" factor is incredibly powerful. While Europe offers fantastic social and travel opportunities, Australia offers a truly unique cultural immersion that you've yearned for. The concerns about distance and insects, while valid, often diminish once you're there and experiencing the reality of a modern, developed country.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always visit Europe later in life for shorter trips, or even after graduation. Australia, being so far, often requires a dedicated, longer trip like a study abroad semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>My advice is to lean into your dream.</b> If you can find a program that fits your Health and Societies major, the personal fulfillment of living out a lifelong dream will likely outweigh the practical advantages of Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Final Action Plan:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b>Academic First:</b> Seriously, do this first. Contact UPenn Study Abroad and your H&S advisor.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Research Specific Programs:</b> Look at the actual courses offered, the city/university, and the general vibe of the programs in both locations. This might clarify things.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Talk to Alumni:</b> Ask the UPenn Study Abroad office if you can connect with students who have studied in both Australia and Europe, especially for your major. Their first-hand accounts will be invaluable.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Trust Your Gut:</b> After gathering all the information, listen to what truly excites you the most.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>You've got this! No matter what you choose, it will be an incredible experience.</b>\n",
