    "I can still remember being a Senior in high school, stressing about the complex college application process. That summer going into the last year was spent brainstorming ideas for the common application essay. Knowing that you could write about anything almost made it even harder to hone down on one topic. Thus, I decided to play around and see how an LLM (anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet) could help make this process a little easier, helping to brainstorm potential prompts and create a college list as well. It's almost like it is a private $100,000 college counseler. I played around and tried my best to give clear directions and prompts to optimize the LLM's output according to the PEGAI reading on Chapter 3."
