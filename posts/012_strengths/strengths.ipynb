    "This year, I entered my second decade of living, and with growing up and finding your sense of identity often comes many self-doubting crises. What should I study? Will I find a job? Do I like my friends? Where do I want to live when I'm older? Finding identity and sense of self isn't easy and something that often comes with time; and stress about a career is often normal when we start to consider internships and working in the real world. As we know, there are many applications that use AI to help tailor resumes, apply to job positions, etc. So, I started wondering, if I gave an LLM a brief explanation of my interests, or a \"walk me thorugh your resume,\" would it be able to help me figure out what I want to do?"

    "### USER\n",
    "Hello! Today I would like some help in figuring out what kind of career path I should take. I have always been interested in healthcare and am studying Health and Societies with a concentration in Healthcare Markets and Finance. As I’ve gained experience in this industry, as a consultant with the Wharton Undergraduate Healthcare Club Consulting Committee, worked on data science projects in classes that dealt with clinical trial data, and taken various healthcare management classes and courses that dive into social disparities in health, I notice that I am passionate about helping people and the social sciences. It is interesting to think about these kinds of ideologies and challenge existing systemic theories in place. However, sometimes I have a hard time with this because the social sciences is in the humanities and often very theoretical. The skills I am learning are qualitative. I feel as though I do better in quantitative classes and also find enjoyment in STEM. What do you think I should do about my studies, and what kind of jobs do you think I could pursue?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Hello! This is an excellent set of interests and experiences, and I want to start by saying that your \"dilemma\" is actually a *tremendous strength*. The ability to bridge the qualitative, critical thinking of the social sciences with the rigor and problem-solving of quantitative methods and STEM is incredibly valuable, especially in healthcare. You are not alone in feeling this pull, and many of the most impactful roles in healthcare today require exactly this kind of interdisciplinary thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down your situation and explore paths forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to do about your studies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your current major, **Health and Societies with a concentration in Healthcare Markets and Finance**, is already a fantastic foundation. It inherently blends social science perspectives with the quantitative and business aspects of healthcare. Here’s how you can further optimize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Embrace and Connect the \"Theoretical\" with the \"Quantitative\":**\n",
    "    *   **Reframing Social Sciences:** Instead of seeing social sciences as \"just theoretical,\" view them as providing the *frameworks* and *questions* that quantitative analysis can then answer. For example, theories about health disparities (social sciences) can be tested, measured, and understood through statistical analysis of clinical trial data or population health data (quantitative).\n",
    "    *   **Look for Quantitative Social Science:** Many fields within social sciences are highly quantitative:\n",
    "        *   **Economics:** Especially health economics, econometrics.\n",
    "        *   **Sociology/Demography:** Using statistical methods to analyze social trends, health behaviors, and population health.\n",
    "        *   **Political Science/Policy Analysis:** Quantitative methods to evaluate policy impact.\n",
    "    *   **Focus on Research Methods:** Seek out courses in advanced research methods, statistics, and program evaluation within the social sciences or public health departments. These courses will teach you how to apply quantitative tools to social questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Double Down on Quantitative Skills (without abandoning your core):**\n",
    "    *   **Minors/Concentrations:** Consider a minor or additional concentration in:\n",
    "        *   **Statistics:** Directly enhances your data analysis skills.\n",
    "        *   **Data Science:** Covers programming (Python/R), machine learning, data visualization.\n",
    "        *   **Computer Science:** Even a foundational understanding can be immensely helpful for data manipulation and understanding technical systems.\n",
    "        *   **Applied Math/Operations Research:** Excellent for optimizing systems, which is crucial in healthcare management.\n",
    "        *   **Economics:** Especially if you enjoy the market and finance aspect, health economics is a very quantitative field.\n",
    "    *   **Targeted Electives:** Take more electives in areas like:\n",
    "        *   Econometrics\n",
    "        *   Advanced Statistics (e.g., Regression Analysis, Causal Inference)\n",
    "        *   Programming for Data Analysis (Python, R)\n",
    "        *   Machine Learning\n",
    "        *   Healthcare Analytics/Informatics\n",
    "    *   **Project-Based Learning:** Seek out opportunities (research assistantships, independent studies) where you can apply quantitative methods to social science questions in healthcare. Your experience with clinical trial data is a perfect example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Leverage Your Wharton Connection:**\n",
    "    *   Wharton offers a strong quantitative and business foundation. Ensure you're taking advantage of courses in finance, operations, and analytics that have a healthcare bent.\n",
    "    *   Your consulting committee experience is valuable – look for projects that allow you to combine strategic thinking with data analysis to solve client problems, perhaps focusing on social impact or health equity challenges within healthcare organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of jobs could you pursue?\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of skills and passions positions you perfectly for a variety of high-impact roles that bridge the gap between healthcare, business, social science, and data. You are essentially looking for roles that use **quantitative methods to drive social impact and improve health systems.**\n",
    "\n",
