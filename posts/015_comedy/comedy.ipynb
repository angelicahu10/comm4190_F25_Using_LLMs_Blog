Generation Z has a very specific type of humor - that is, most jokes have no reasoning behind them or seem to make sense. It's more of a \"if you know, you know\" kind of situation which is why perhaps AI was off. For instance, instead of saying \"I'm deceased!\" the average Gen-Zer would have said \"I'm dead!\" Perhaps that isn't too appropraite here and the LLM is trying to stay censored.
