    "After learning about mermaid sequence in class and how information could be displayed in flowcharts, I decided to experiment with this method by narrating a different happy ever after ending for Ariel, The Little Mermaid. (Note my play on words). By playing with the sequence, I showed at a basic level how Ariel's fate could have turned out if there were different decisions made at the milestone where she fell in love with Prince Eric. Doing so is a bit silly to see as we know all Disney movies and princesses have their happy ending."
