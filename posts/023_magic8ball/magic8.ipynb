    "A Magic 8 Ball is a novelty toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It's a hollow plastic sphere, designed to look like an oversized black and white 8-ball from pool, that contains a 20-sided die floating in a dark liquid. Each face of the die has a different answer printed on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you ask the Magic 8 Ball a yes-or-no question, shake it, and then turn it over to reveal an answer that appears in a small window on the bottom. Answers range from affirmative (\"It is certain,\" \"Yes definitely\"), to non-committal (\"Reply hazy, try again,\" \"Ask again later\"), to negative (\"Don't count on it,\" \"My sources say no\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The Magic 8 Ball was invented in the 1940s and has become a popular cultural icon and toy that's still sold today.\n",
