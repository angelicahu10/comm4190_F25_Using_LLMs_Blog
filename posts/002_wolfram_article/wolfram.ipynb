    "The way that LLMs basically create output is with \"reasonable continuation,\" looking at the response with the highest probability. I think it's super interesting to learn that ChatGpt or other models are basically just making their best guesses at what makes sense, using lots of randomness to come up with non-flat responses. There's an infinite combination of possible sequences with no correct answer. It was super cool to see how the next word that is outputted is based on the previous word, which then becomes sequences. I found it much easier to understand this complex process when breaking it down from letters, to words, to sentences. "
