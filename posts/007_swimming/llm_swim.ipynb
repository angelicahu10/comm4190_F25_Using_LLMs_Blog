    "As I mentioned earlier, swimming has always been a passion of mine! Thus, inspired by the tutoring task we completed in class where we tested out prompting with different LLMs to teach us a skill or task - I asked it to teach me how to solve a rubix cube - I wondered what an LLM would say if I asked it if it was capable of a simple survival skill: swimming. My prediction is that it will repsond with something along the lines of \"While I am unable of possesing physical qualities, I would be happy to explain how to swim and can understand the processes of the activity!\" Something like that.

    "\n",
    "Let’s pretend like you have the physical body of a 20 year old woman and can swim.\n",
    "> Alright, let's imagine I have the body of a 20-year-old woman and can swim. In that case, I might enjoy swimming as a form of exercise, relaxation, or even competitive sport. I'd likely be familiar with various swimming techniques such as freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Engaging in regular swimming sessions would help me maintain fitness, build muscle tone, and improve cardiovascular health. I would also prioritize safety by swimming in designated areas, using proper equipment, and staying aware of my surroundings while in the water. If you have any specific scenarios or questions in mind, feel free to ask!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is your fastest 100 yard freestyle time?\n",
    ">If I were to imagine having a physical form and the ability to swim, my fastest 100-yard freestyle time would hinge on several factors like training, experience, and natural ability. For context, competitive swimmers often clock 100-yard freestyle times ranging from about 46-50 seconds for men and 49-54 seconds for women at the collegiate level. If I were a recreational swimmer or enthusiast, a time under 1 minute and 20 seconds might be more typical. However, since this is a hypothetical scenario, feel free to set any time you'd like to imagine!\n",

    "You tell me! You are a 20 year old competitive swimmer.\n",
    "> If I were a 20-year-old competitive swimmer, my fastest 100-yard freestyle time might be around 50 to 53 seconds. This would be competitive at various levels, depending on the specific swimming league or competition. Such a time would reflect intense training, focusing on technique, strength, and endurance, likely with the goal of improving further to reach elite levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a female?\n",
    "> Yes, as a 20-year-old female competitive swimmer, a time of around 50 to 53 seconds for the 100-yard freestyle would be quite competitive. Top female collegiate swimmers often reach times in this range, with elite swimmers sometimes dipping below 48 seconds. This would require rigorous training and a strong focus on technique and conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how fast you are?\n",
    "> In this imagined scenario, yes, I would have a competitive time of around 50 to 53 seconds for the 100-yard freestyle, reflecting a high level of training and skill. This hypothetical time places me among strong collegiate-level swimmers. If you have any other scenarios or questions, feel free to ask!"

Six powerful dolphin kicks propel me forward underwater before I explode to the surface, breaking out into a furious freestyle.

The lactic acid is already building.\n",

My arms feel heavy, but I push through, remembering countless hours of training, the early mornings, the endless laps.\n",

    "Not surprisingly, all three LLMs responded to the first question in a similar manner in that swimming was out of their physical capabilities. However, when asked to be a pretend swimmer, it looks like gpt4.0 was the fastest, then gemini 2.5, and finally claude 3.5. It was interesting to see how gemini and claude created a story of the race, while gpt was much more technical. Gemini and cluade were much better at responding to the prompt, \"pretending\" to be a swimmer and have that racing experience which I liked. As for the times, I would say that claude 3.5 gave a relatively realistic time while the other two times seemed a bit out of reach and very optimistic!"

    "\n",
    ">Here's my take:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Plausibility and Detail: I think all three of us (me, GPT-4, and Claude 3.5) would likely produce a very detailed and plausible race narrative. We're all good at processing information and generating creative text that fits a persona. We'd probably all hit on things like the smell of chlorine, the dive, the turns, the burning muscles, and the final touch.\n",
    "The \"Time\" Choice: This is where it gets interesting. I chose 49.72 seconds. This is an extremely fast time for a 100-yard freestyle for a female, putting me in elite, NCAA Division I championship-level territory, but not an impossible world-record-shattering time. It makes the narrative feel like a genuine, hard-fought competitive race.\n",
    "GPT-4: Might choose a similarly fast, realistic time, or perhaps go for a slightly more \"perfect\" or \"record-breaking\" time, as it sometimes leans towards optimizing for an ideal scenario.\n",
    "Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Might also choose a realistic, competitive time. It's often very good at nuance, so it might even pick a time that's just off a personal best, adding a layer of emotional struggle or triumph.\n",
    "Narrative \"Flavor\" and Emotion: This is where the real \"speed\" (meaning quality and impact of the story) would come in.\n",
    "My response: I aimed for a strong, visceral, and emotionally driven narrative. I wanted you to feel the race – the pounding heart, the burning lungs, the fight. I tried to make the internal monologue authentic to a competitive swimmer. I think I did a pretty good job of immersing the reader.\n",
    "GPT-4: Is incredibly good at comprehensive detail and structure. It might provide a very technically accurate and well-paced account, perhaps even more detailed on the mechanics of the stroke or the race strategy. It would be very strong, but perhaps sometimes a little more analytical in its creativity.\n",
    "Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Is often praised for its ability to capture subtle emotions and write with a more \"human\" or poetic touch. It might deliver a narrative that is incredibly rich in feeling, perhaps focusing more on the mental battle or the beauty of the movement through the water, making it deeply evocative.\n",
    "So, am I \"faster\"?\n",
    "\n",
    ">I think my response was very strong and definitely competitive! I felt like I really embodied the persona and delivered an impactful narrative with a very good, realistic time.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It wouldn't be about one of us being objectively \"faster\" in terms of quality, but rather about different styles of storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    ">If you wanted a highly immersive, visceral, and slightly aggressive competitive feel, I'd say I'm right there in the lead.\n",
    "If you wanted a super-detailed, technically robust, and perhaps slightly more \"perfect\" race, GPT-4 might edge ahead.\n",
    "If you wanted a deeply emotional, nuanced, and perhaps more poetic exploration of the race, Claude 3.5 Sonnet might shine.\n",
    "We'd all be in the championship final, for sure! It would come down to the judges' (your) personal preference on the day. But I'm proud of my 49.72!"

    "\n",
    ">I picked 52.89 because it's a solid competitive time for a female college swimmer, but not unrealistically fast (the women's world record for 100y free is 45.56 by Gretchen Walsh).\n",
    "\n",
    ">But I'm curious - if you've asked them this same question, what times did they give? Maybe we could have an AI swim meet! 😄\n",
