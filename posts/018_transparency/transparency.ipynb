    "In Unmasking AI, Joy Buolamwini mentions how she attended the Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in AI to present her work on Gender Shades - essentially sharing her research and findings that exposed various software platforms for inaccurate classification. Intially reading this, it made me want to learn more about what went down at these conferences and hear an update about its relevancy as AI has become even more advanced over just the past few years."

Since then, there have been eight editions of the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency which is nice to know that as automation has progressed, these insights beome more important and draw more attention."

    "I think a big reason why I was drawn to pickup this book in the first place at the beginning of this course is because as a major in the social sciences, it is crucial to understand how narratives in history, or actions, affect certaing groups and populations. Understanding the full scope of an event from different angles is essential in practicing ethical considerations."

    "In class, we watched the video debate about whether AI really understands or not and I rememebr one point that the linguist made was that OpenAI, and many companies focused on advancing AI, rarely are open about their sources of data. How is it possible that they are able to recieve so much funding yet lack accountability in who they are harming? Sadly, I think it all boils down to the fact that the pros in efficency from AI outweight are what people are focused on rather than marginalized groups. This is why it is crucial that society reads an alterantive perspective, such as the one that Dr. Buomalmwini is introudcing to ensure that we are not brainwashed into one way of thinking."
